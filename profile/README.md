# Secret Card Club

## What is it?
An iOS playing card sandbox game for up to 8 players. It allows users to play most games that use a 52-card deck. Upon starting the app on their phone a user is invited to login or signup and then enter a game room with their friends. The game room is a simple and ituitive sandbox with a 52-card deck and play area. The interactivity of the cards is made with a combination of drag and drop fuctionality, gestures, and menus for less intuitive interactions, like shuffling. Users can play any game they want: Gin, Hearts, Solitaire, and Euchre all work great. Games involving speed or manual dexterity don't translate particularily well. 

## How is it built?
The app was build using React-Native, Expo, Styled Components, uWebSockets, PostgreSQL, and Express.
